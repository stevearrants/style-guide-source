Principles for user content
===========================

Start with user needs
---------------------

Write in a way that suits the situation. Ask yourself: *Who am I writing
for? What do they need to know? What is their situation, constraints,
and environment?*

Help people find the information they need quickly and easily. Guide
them through the journey.

Do the hard work to make it simple
----------------------------------

* Use plain language and simple sentences.
* Be clear, not clever.
* Write as if you're speaking to your mom or dad.
* Write for the audience, not yourself

Our end-users, customers, and all readers have complex experiences and
backgrounds. Respect that.

Know the audience. I can't stress this enough! Talk to them. Don't ask
what they *want*. Observe and give them what they *need*.

Build trust with the reader
---------------------------

* Talk like a person, not Siri or Amazon Echo.
* Don't sugar coat a problem. Tell the truth.
* Use positive language and concrete, real world examples.
* Start small and build big
-------------------------

Does your content works for users? Don't be afraid to rethink and
rewrite.

Write a draft. Test on your users and readers. Examine their feedback.
Refine. Make it better, test it out, gather feedback, and keep refining.
