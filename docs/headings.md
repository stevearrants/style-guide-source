Headings and titles
===================

Most people scan the page and make decisions based on headings. Make
them active and descriptive.

Find the right keywords
-----------------------

Ask co-workers what keywords they would expect to use. Ask end users.
What you're calling the subject of your page might not be what your
users are calling it. While our Help files use a full-text search,
Windows Server and Confluence rely more on exact matches. Pay special
attention to keywords and search terms for you headings.

Optimize the content
--------------------

Once you know the most popular keywords, incorporate them in:

* Titles
* Headings
* Introductions and summaries
* Chapter and section titles
* Metadata descriptions
