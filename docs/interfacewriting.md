Interface writing
=================

We often write technical documentation, guides, forms, and interface
messages. In most of these cases, it's safe to say the reader is
learning something new or troubleshooting. Write clear, concise
instructions that give your reader with the best possible experience.

Basics
------

### Do the hard work to make it simple

Help the reader follow along. Break instructions or processes down into
individual steps. Use short, simple sentences with words people use in
everyday conversation.

Refer to navigation labels, buttons, and menus as they appear in the app
or website. Verify the spelling and capitalization as you write. Your
reader looks for the same name as in the instruction. Always boldface
interface items and omit any terminal punctuation from the bold.

Be specific and give the reader as much help as you can.

Instead of:

> Open a new support ticket.

Use:

> Click **Help > Contact Technical Support**.

### Direct the reader

Use active verbs and clear objectives.

Instead of:

> We can help you if you create a JIRA Service Desk request.

Use:

> Click **JIRA Service Desk** to create a help request. Include details
> about your problem.

Or:

> To get started, click the **JIRA Service Desk** link to create a new
> ticket. Remember to include the details of your problem.

Focus on what the reader can do rather than what they
can't using positive language.

Instead of:

> You cannot submit without answering all queries.

Use:

> Answer any open queries and then submit the proof.

Guidelines
----------

### Titles and headings

Use consistent naming by sticking to the same naming convention. This
makes it easier for the reader to scan and find what she's looking for.
For examples:

-   **Nouns** -- *Proofs*, *Users*, *Task*
-   **Verbs** -- *Create an account*, *Print a report*, *Submit a proof*

Use sentence case for headings.

### Introduction

Include a short two- or three-sentence summary about the document to
help the reader confirm whether they're in the right place, and also to
improve searchability.

### Interface elements

Use clear verbs to tell readers how to interact with interface elements:

*Choose* from drop-down menus.

*Select* or *clear* checkboxes and radio buttons.

*Click* or *tap* buttons.

*Follow* or *open* links.

Bold interface names and choices:

1.  Click **File > Open**. Word opens the **File** dialog box.
2.  Select the file.
3.  Click **OK**.

Always use the spelling, grammar, and exact names seen in the interface
element.

### User input

Use italic to distinguish user input from plain text. For example,

> Type the exact name of the dialog box, such as *Exit system*.

### Command line items

Command line items should be in monospace, such as Courier, Consolas, or
similar. Do not use italic for this form of user input.

 At the C: prompt, type the following: ``chkdsk /v /f`` and press **Enter**.
