Avoid duplication
=================

If something is written once and you can easily link to it, do so.
Duplicate content produces poor search results, confuses the user, and
you can't be sure it is current.

If users can find two similar yet slightly different pieces of content they will stop what they are doing and ask for guidance. Worse, some
just decide the first one they found is correct, or the one with the
latest date, or the file found in a specific folder.

At SJS we have hundreds of file folders on many, many servers. That's a
lot of content needlessly duplicated. Consolidate. Direct
the reader to the right location &mdash; ask someone if you aren't sure.

Before you start writing, check to see it hasn't already been written.
Ask someone.
