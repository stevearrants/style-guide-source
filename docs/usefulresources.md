Useful Resources
=========

My background is in user assistance and documentation that uses plain
language and accessibility. Here are some guides I use when I have a
question.

Style guides
------------

I generally follow [Microsoft Writing Style
Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/).![](Resources/Images/offsite-link.png)
I use this for computer, interface, and software terms, unless otherwise
noted. The other important resource I use are:

-   [The Chicago Manual of Style, 16th
    ed.](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html)
    ![](Resources/Images/offsite-link.png)
-   [Plain Language Action and Information Network
    ![](Resources/Images/offsite-link.png)](http://www.plainlanguage.gov/)
-   [Diversity Style Guide
    ![](Resources/Images/offsite-link.png)](http://www.diversitystyleguide.com/)

I just found this site, [The Punctuation
Guide](http://www.thepunctuationguide.com/index.html)
![](Resources/Images/offsite-link.png), for all things punctuation.

Sheridan Terms
--------------

The Production group has a nicely comprehensive list of terms specific
to SJS.

For questions about the Sheridan corporate logo and branding
information, I go to Sheridan Logos and
Branding on the shared server.
