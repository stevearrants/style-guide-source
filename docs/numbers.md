Numbers and percentages
=======================

Numbers
-------

Generally speaking, we follow the guidelines outlined in the Microsoft
Manual of Style, Fourth Edition However, if the document is for a more
general audience and isn't primarily instruction, follow <a href="http://login.chicagomanualofstyle.org/action/login" target="_new"> The Chicago
Manual of Style, 16th edition</a>![](Resources/Images/offsite-link.png)

In body copy, spell out numbers zero through nine, and use numerals for
numbers 10 and greater. This is true of ordinal numbers, as well. Spell
out first to ninth, and then use 10th or greater.

In titles, subheadings, and interface labels, we use numerals instead of
spelling out numbers. For example, *10 tips for using FreeStyle* or *6
steps to better footnotes*. This promotes ease of reading and
scannability. In titles and headings, it's easier for readers to scan
numerals than it is for them to scan written-out numbers.

Dates
-----

Use the full, four-digit year. For informal writing, it's okay to use an
abbreviated form. For example*, We're thankful printing technology isn't
stuck in the '90s!*

Do not use dates only such as *10/2/19*. In the USÂ we read that as
October 2, 2019. In other parts of the world, it is 10 February 2019.

Percentages
-----------

Spell out *percent* in most cases. However, use the percent sign (%) in
these cases to improve content scannability and allow readers to digest
the content more quickly:

* Tables and in technical or scientific writing. For example: *If the progress meter sits at 60% or lower for more than 20 minutes, close the program and start again.*
* Headings and subheadings. For example: *Clearing 100% of all errors.*
* Interface labels.
* Captions.
