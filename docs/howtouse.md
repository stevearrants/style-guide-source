How to use this guide
=====================

Introduction
------------

This guide helps technology writers create content that is both easy to
understand and meets people where they are. Documentation often just
talks *at* readers and end-users rather than *to* or *with* them. Most
writing leaves this audience frustrated by information that is neither
actionable nor understandable.

This guide hopes to address this and offers several common-sense
guidelines about writing for a diverse audience. Using this guide is the
first step in collaborating with the audience, incorporating their
experience and feedback into the process, and communicating in a
consistent manner.

If you work in Technology
-------------------------

Use this guide as a reference as&ndash;needed. Use it when you're wondering
whether to capitalize the word *submit*, for instance, or when you're
wondering how to create a friendly, informational document.

IÂ structured this guide into descriptively named sections. Find the
topic you're looking for in the table of contents or search by keyword.
Use it the way that makes sense to you.

If you work outside Technology
------------------------------

Use this guide and adapt it to your group's needs. This is just a
guide. If a section isn't relevant to you and your team, ignore it. If
there is something missing, let me know and I'll add it.
