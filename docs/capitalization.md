Capitalization
==============

Follow a consistent capitalization scheme
-----------------------------------------

Inconsistent spellings and capitalization undermine your narrative
authority. Follow these capitalization guidelines:

*  Capitalize proper nouns, including names of individuals, places, and companies.
*  Don't capitalize *agile* or *open source*, unless either opens a sentence.
*  Don't capitalize *submit* as an action, but do capitalize it if it is the name of an interface item or the first word of a sentence.

When you're deciding whether to capitalize noun phrases, keep in mind
that in English, title case is often a marker of formality. It can help
clarify that you're speaking about a specific, official thing (such as a
form, office, or person). But overuse can cause confusion.

Headings
--------

Headlines, page titles, subheads, and similar content should follow
sentence case, and should not include a trailing colon. For example:

-   Using the Insert Citation command on your proof
-   ARTEMISÂ roles and responsibilities
