Active voice
============

Our writing should be concise and direct. The active voice supports
brevity and makes written content more engaging, too. The active voice
helps the reader identify the subject of the sentence. In the following
example, the person who submits the form is essential information.
Omitting that leads to a confusing and impersonal sentence.

> Passive: The Tobacco Waiver form must be submitted to the appropriate
> representative.

> Active: Submit the Tobacco Waiver form to Human Resources.

The passive de-emphasizes who should take an action and anything written
in the passive voice is usually longer. Wordy instructions are harder to
follow.

> Passive: The JIRA notice should be saved in your email, as it will be
> required for future inquiries.
>
> Active: Save the JIRA notice in your email for later use.

When in doubt, cut directly to the verb and give the reader clear
directions.

How to recognize the passive voice
----------------------------------

Use of the passive voice is common enough that many people don't notice
when they use it. Here's a simple way to recognize it. If you insert *by
zombies* after the verb and the sentence still makes sense, you're using
the passive voice.

> The form was submitted by zombies.
>
> Ted's oatmeal cookies were consumed by zombies.

When to use the passive voice
-----------------------------

There are always exceptions. Never use the passive voice in a way that
makes actions seem like they happen without anyone doing them. In our
documentation, we should always make it clear who (or what) is doing
something.

You may need to use the passive voice to soften an error message or make
something easier to understand.

Rewording either of these sentences to use the active voice would
complicate the sentence or pull focus away from its main point:

> Responses sent from JIRA include Waiting for Support and Closed.
>
> Support is required to respond to requests within 4 working hours.
