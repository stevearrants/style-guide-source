Images
======

Graphics and other visual elements clarify. Screen shots are easy to
produce and format using SnagIt and other tools.

* **Address the user** Focus on illustrating or drawing attention to specific points you want them to understand.
* **Be concise** Don't go crazy. Use the images to enhance, not overwhelm the document.
* **Be conscious** Use real examples with the most current software.

Common uses of imagery
----------------------

Screenshots can go a long way in explaining design and user-experience
techniques in how-to pieces. Use them to illustrate functionality, show
users a series of steps, or give examples.

An image that spans the full width of a web page should be no more than
800 pixels wide. If possible, use vector images in the SVG format as
they scale well. Use PNG if you can't use SVG. Captions aren't
necessary in procedures

If your content will be viewed on hand-held devices, use responsive images.
That is, provide different image sizes depending on the
device.

For documents created with Flare or other online tools, take the screen
shot and reduce to 72-75% in SnagIt. Then use the Sharpen filter set at
between 72-75%. Place in Flare and set to display the thumbnail as a
pop-up image. Please contact Steve Arrants for assistance.

Copyrighted images
------------------

Don't use them, even if the document is internal to Sheridan. Don't
alter a copyrighted image and use it. Instead, search for and use public
domain <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0" target=_"new">CC0 Images</a>

Accessibility
-------------

While we aren't required to follow <a href="http://www.508checker.com/what-is-508-compliance" target="new"> Section 508</a>
![](Resources/Images/offsite-link.png) guidelines, some of our customers
are required to comply with Section 508. They may expect or require
vendors (such as SJS) to comply as well. The broad requirement is that
any information presented in an image must also be presented in an
alternative format (for people who cannot view images).

The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/" target="_new">W3C Web Accessibility initiative</a>
![](Resources/Images/offsite-link.png) is a
good resource for all web accessibility issues.

Every image presented online must have alt text describing the image.
Additionally, any text that appears in the image must also appear in the
alt text. Most screen readers already add *Image of* when reading out an
image, so alt text like *Image of Edit Citation dialog box* is redundant
because screen readers will read it *Image of image of edit citation
dialog box*. Try to limit alt text to 15 to 25 words. if you need to have
a longer explanation, add it to the page as a description for the action
involved.

When captioning an image, don't add additional context or information.
Don't merely repeat what the user sees by looking at the image. Captions
should increase depth and understanding.
