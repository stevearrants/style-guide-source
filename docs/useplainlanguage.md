Use plain language
==================

Our content should be as straightforward as possible
----------------------------------------------------

Clear and usable content uses plain language. Plain language makes our
content more findable, more accessible, and easier to understand.

Jargon, formal language, and long phrases separate us from the reader
and erode trust. They also lead to misinterpretation and confusion.

Figurative language doesn't say what you actually mean and makes content
harder to understand. Here are some examples:

* **drive** (you can only drive vehicles, not schemes or people)
* **drive out** (unless it's cattle)
* **going forward** (unless you're giving directions)

To avoid this, describe what you're actually doing. Be specific. Be
open.

Don't say *Input your change.* Say *Type your change.* Input can have a lot of meanings. Use the specific word.

Think of your writing as a conversation, not a lecture.

Don't use formal or long words when easy or short words say the same
thing. Use *help* instead of *assist*, *about* instead of
*approximately*.

Plain language is more than just a proscriptive list though, it's a way
of writing.

Words to avoid
--------------
* abort, kill, terminate (except in technical, programming documentation)
* collaborate -- use *working with*
* dialogue is used for conversations, *dialog* is the interface item, as in dialog box
* execute -- use *run* or *do* instead
* in order to -- use *to*
* initiate -- use *start*
* input -- use *type* or *enter* or *select*
* simple or simply. Avoid these as something simple to a power user isn't so simple to a new user.
* utilize. *Use* is a better choice. 

What about legal terms?
-----------------------

**Never** rewrite legal information, such as a copyright, terms of use
statements, privacy statement, or other document that could open SJSÂ to
litigation. These documents are express or implied contracts. Ask our
legal department for assistance.
