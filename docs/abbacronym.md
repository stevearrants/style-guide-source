Abbreviations and acronyms
==========================

Abbreviations are any shortened or contracted word or phrase. For
example, writing *HWP* instead of *High Wire Press*, or *PAP* for
*Publish Ahead of Print*.

In the most technical sense, there is a difference between acronyms
(abbreviations pronounced as words, like ARTEMIS) and initialisms
(abbreviations pronounced as letters, like HWP). This guide refers to
both as acronyms. The readability issues that acronyms and initialisms
create tend to be similar.

Acronyms often confuse readers. Avoid them whenever possible, unless
you're writing for an internal, Sheridan audience  already familiar with them.

If an acronym is necessary for future reference, spell the full word and
follow with the acronym in parentheses on the first reference. For
example, *ARTEMIS closes the task after PAP (Publish Ahead of Print)*.

Some acronyms are more recognizable than their full spellings. For
example, *SJS*. In such instances, the acronym is always acceptable, at
the writer's discretion.
